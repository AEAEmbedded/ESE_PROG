# Prog5/6 Course Repository

This repository contains my work for the Prog5 programming course, focusing on Arduino development and potentially sensor interfacing.

## Content Overview

* **Code:** Arduino sketches and C++ code for various exercises and projects.
  * `LibDemoArduinoToF`: Examples using Time-of-Flight sensors.
  * `BlinkWithoutDelay`: Demonstrates non-blocking blinking techniques.
  * `I2CHelper`, `I2CBox`: Libraries and examples for I2C communication.
  * `VL6180X`: Code related to the VL6180X distance sensor.
* **Labs:** Specific lab exercises and associated files.
  * `Prog5_Lab3_I2CSensorLib.md`: Instructions or documentation for Lab 3.
* **Notes:** Lecture notes and additional resources.
  * `Keynotes_1_Introduction.pdf` etc.: PDFs covering various course topics.
* **Rubrics:** Grading rubrics for assignments and projects.
* **Other:**
  * `HAN_Hackaton_Prog_6_2025.pdf`: Potentially related to a hackathon.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/AEAEmbedded/ESE_PROG`
2. **Navigate to the relevant folder:** `cd [folder name]`
3. **Open Arduino sketches in the Arduino IDE.**
4. **Upload code to your Arduino board.**
5. **Refer to notes and lab instructions for guidance.**

## Key Topics Covered

* Constructors, inline functions, default parameters
* Lists and more advanced data structures
* Interfacing and abstract classes
* Threading and callbacks
* Polymorphism

Labs:
* Arduino basics using SOLID / OOP (blinking, timing)
* I2C communication and sensor interfacing
* MQTT and Raspberry Pi (more high level focus)
